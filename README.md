# Stick2006
This game is essentially a get the highest score, collect the most coins, kind of game. Think Subway
Surfers but as the Chrome Dinosaur game. It's a 2D side-scrolling game where you jump and try to avoid
obstacles for as long as you can. If Flappy Bird can make it big so can I.

This is an idea where the game is currently at:

Note: This is my first platformer game, and my first full project made using Unity with Visual Studio. I'm
hoping to use the knowledge gained from building this to apply to future games/applications.

## How to Build
Open the project in Unity then goto File -> Build Settings -> and ensure the settings are as follows:

Open Scenes:
- Scene/StartMenu   (0)
- Scene/main        (1)

Platform: 
**iOS**

After just press Build and Run and it should open and build in XCode. 

## Contributing
To be upright and honest, I am **NOT** a graphic designer. While I can code, I suck at graphics (which is
why this is a really minimal graphical game) and most of the graphics look like they were drawn by a 10 
year old. So, if you want to contribute, where I really need it most is anything graphic related,
think backgrounds, platform designs, buttons, you name it and it probably needs improving.
